        <li><b>tomatoes:</b> 2 medium (chopped) </li>

        <li><b>red scotch bonnet pepper:</b> 2 (chopped)</li>
        <li><b>garlic:</b> 3 cloves (minced)</li>
        <li><b>ginger:</b> 25g (grated)</li>
        <li><b>vegetable oil:</b> 150ml</li>
    
    </ul>
    <u><b>For the rice:</b></u>
    <ul>
        <li><b>long grain parboiled rice:</b> 2 cups (washed)</li>
        <li><b>chicken stock:</b> 2 1/2 cups</li>
        <li><b>tomato paste:</b> 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li><b>bay leaves:</b> 2</li>
        <li><b>thyme:</b> 1 teaspoon (dried)</li>
        <li><b>curry powder:</b> 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><b>salt:</b> to taste</li>
        <li><b>black pepper:</b> to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the base ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven set over a medium heat. Add the onion<br>and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, then add the tomato purée and cook,<br> stirring frequently, until it begins to darken, 3 to 5 minutes,</li>

        <li>Pour in the blended base, stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to <br>medium-low and partially cover the pot with the lid – it will splatter! Cook, stirring occasionally,<br> until the sauce is reduced by about a third of its original volume and the<br> oil begins to separate from the sauce, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the curry powder, thyme, stock cubes, bay leaves and water. <br>Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover and bring to a boil over medium-<br>high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the rice, stir to combine, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 25-30 minutes,<br> or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve with fried plantains, steamed vegetables, or your choice of protein.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><strong>Tips</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Jollof rice is a little tricky to master. After the 25 minutes of cooking time, if the rice is sauce-logged, take the lid off <br>the pot to cook off any excess moisture. If the rice is dry and/or undercooked, stir in 100 ml to 200 ml water, cover<br> and continue to steam over low heat.
</li>
    </ul>
